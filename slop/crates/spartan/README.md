# slop-spartan

Spartan proof system for R1CS instances.

Implements the Spartan proof system for Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS), providing succinct proofs for general computation expressed as constraint systems.

## Features

- Lincheck protocol for linear constraint checking
- Prodcheck protocol for product constraint checking
- R1CS sparse matrix conversion to sparse vector compatible with the PGSPCS.
- Prover and verifier implementations
