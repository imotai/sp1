# slop-pgspcs

Pretty Good Sparse Polynomial Commitment Scheme.

A "naive" sparse multilinear polynomial commitment scheme used in conjunction with Spartan for R1CS proving. PGSPCS provides efficient commitments to sparse polynomials where most coefficients are zero. This is necessary to provide efficient access to the R1CS matrices in Spartan.

## Features

- Sparse polynomial commitment and opening
