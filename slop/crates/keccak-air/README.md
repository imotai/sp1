# slop-keccak-air

Re-exports [`p3_keccak_air`](https://crates.io/crates/p3_keccak_air) from [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3) for use in the SLOP library.

This crate provides an AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation) for the Keccak-256 hash function. It defines the constraints needed to prove correct Keccak computations inside a proof system that can prove AIRs.
