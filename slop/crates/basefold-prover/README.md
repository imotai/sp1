# slop-basefold-prover

BaseFold prover implementation.

Provides the prover side of the BaseFold polynomial commitment scheme, which uses a combination of Reed-Solomon encoding and folding to achieve efficient commitments with logarithmic proof sizes.

## Features

- BaseFold polynomial encoder
- Efficient batch proving for multiple polynomials
- Foundation for stacked BaseFold PCS implemented in `slop-stacked`.
