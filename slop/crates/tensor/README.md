# slop-tensor

N-dimensional tensor operations for polynomial proof systems.

The `Tensor` struct is the core data structure in SLOP, providing efficient storage and operations for multi-dimensional arrays of field elements used throughout the proof system.

## Features

- N-dimensional tensor representation
- Efficient dot products and inner products
- Reduction and sum operations
- Transpose and reshape operations
- Generic over memory backends for CPU/GPU portability
